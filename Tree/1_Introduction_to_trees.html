<h1>Introduction to trees</h1>

<strong>Tree:</strong>
It is a non-linear data structure which organizes data in hierarchial structure recursively
<ul>
     <li>In a tree every individual element is called node.</li>
     <li>In a tree with n nodes there will be n-1 edges.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tree Terminologies</h2>
<li>
     <strong>Root: </strong>First node of the tree.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Edge: </strong>Connecting link between two nodes.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Parent: </strong>Tree node which has child/children, ie. any node which is predecessor to any other
     node.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Child: </strong>Descendent of any node.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Siblings: </strong>Nodes with same parent.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Leaf: </strong>Nodes which do not have children, also called the terminal/external nodes.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Internal Nodes: </strong>Nodes with atleast one child.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Degree: </strong>Number of children a node has.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Level: </strong>Root node is at level 0, its children on level 1 and so on...
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Height: </strong>Total number of edges from leaf to the node in longest path. Height of leaf nodes is 1.
     Height of root node is height of tree that is number of edges from farthest leaf node to root + 1.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Depth: </strong>Total number of edges from root to that node. Depth of root node is 1. Depth of tree is
     number of edges from root to farthest leaf node + 1.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Path: </strong>Sequence of nodes and edges between two nodes.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Diameter: </strong>Longest path between two nodes. Path does not need to pass via root. It is sum of height
     of the left subtree and height of right subtree.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Sub-tree: </strong>Tree formed by a node and its children recursively
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Ancestor: </strong>Nodes occuring in path to root.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Full Binary Tree: </strong>Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Complete Binary Tree: </strong>All levels are completely fiilled except the last level. The last level has
     all nodes on left as possible.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Perfect Binary Tree: </strong>All left nodes are on the same level.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Balanced Binary Tree: </strong>Height of tree should be at maximum log(n) where n is number of nodes.
</li>
<li>
     <strong>Degenerate Tree: </strong>Skewed tree which is not balanced.
</li>
</ul>
